# Third Bash Exercise

Write a script that takes a filename and 3 keywords. It should
`grep` in the file for all 3 keywords and display for each keyword the number of
matches and the lines where they meeting.

- No other output on *stdout* should be produced by the script
- If the file cannot be read the script should exit with a return code 1, else
with code 0 (see **help** exit if you do not know the exit command)
